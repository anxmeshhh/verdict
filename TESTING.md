# Manual test checklist — every aspect of the system

Organized by module/feature so nothing built so far is untested. Each item
is tagged **[P0]** (honesty guarantee — must never fail), **[P1]** (core
feature correctness), or **[P2]** (resilience/edge case).

Automated evidence for the gated phases lives in [`phase0/`](./phase0) and
[`phase1/gate_results.json`](./phase1/gate_results.json). This is the
human-run companion — it covers everything built after the Phase 1 gate
passed, plus a live sanity pass on the gated behavior itself.

Suggested test bed: a small throwaway repo with an intentional, subtle bug —
e.g. an in-memory login rate limiter that claims "5 attempts per account per
minute" but is actually keyed by IP address instead of account. No
network/DB dependency (so the sandbox runs it directly), and the bug is a
real intent-vs-behavior mismatch, not a syntax error.

## 1. Config & Setup

- [ ] **[P1]** `verdict init` with no flags → default `ollama` provider, correct model
- [ ] **[P1]** `verdict init --provider openrouter` (unknown provider) → rejected with valid-options message
- [ ] **[P1]** `config get` (no key) → lists all keys, `api_key` masked as `****xxxx`
- [ ] **[P1]** `config set` for each key: `model`, `ollama_url`, `provider`, `api_key`, `base_url`
- [ ] **[P1]** `config set provider <invalid>` → rejected, config unchanged
- [ ] **[P0]** `.verdict/audit.jsonl` after any `config set api_key ...` → key appears masked, never raw
- [ ] **[P1]** `verdict health` → three independent checks (config/LLM/Docker), each can fail without affecting the others' reporting

## 2. Intent Extractor

- [ ] **[P1]** `extract_from_commit` — diff + message of a single ref
- [ ] **[P1]** `extract_from_range` (`--base`) — diff across a range, intent from combined commit subjects (all subjects present, not just HEAD's)
- [ ] **[P0]** **Regression: one vague commit must not poison a range with real history underneath.** If HEAD's message is a throwaway (`"wip"`) but an earlier commit in the same range is genuinely descriptive, the range must NOT be flagged vague — only flag a range vague if every commit subject in it is independently vague
- [ ] **[P1]** `extract_from_working_tree` (`--intent`) — uncommitted diff + explicit intent
- [ ] **[P0]** Vagueness detection catches: too-short message, placeholder patterns (`"wip"`, `"fix"`, `"final"`), low content-word count
- [ ] **[P0]** Vagueness detection does NOT false-positive on a real, descriptive intent
- [ ] **[P1]** `--path <file>` scopes the diff to exactly that file/folder across all three extraction modes

## 3a. Scenario Generator (the one bounded LLM step)

- [ ] **[P1]** Normal generation → valid scenario list parsed from JSON
- [ ] **[P1]** Malformed JSON on first attempt → retries (MAX_ATTEMPTS=2), succeeds or fails cleanly
- [ ] **[P0]** Refuses to run against a vague intent (raises, doesn't generate garbage scenarios)
- [ ] **[P0]** Refuses to run against an empty diff
- [ ] **[P1]** Token/timing counters populate correctly on the run record

## 3b. Scenario Authoring (manual)

- [ ] **[P1]** `plan --manual` writes an editable YAML template
- [ ] **[P0]** Running with unedited `example_` placeholder scenarios → refused, not silently accepted
- [ ] **[P1]** `load_scenarios` accepts both YAML and JSON

## 4. Scenario Validator

- [ ] **[P0]** A scenario that traces to real diff content is kept
- [ ] **[P0]** A hallucinated/generic scenario with no traceable overlap is dropped, and the drop reason is shown
- [ ] **[P0]** 0/N scenarios traceable → run finishes as **UNVERIFIED** (via `_finish_unverified`), never a silent error or a faked risk level

## 5. Sandbox Runner

- [ ] **[P0]** **Regression: repo modules are importable.** A generated test doing `from <repo module> import X` succeeds — this is the exact bug that was shipping silent `UNVERIFIED` results; check it explicitly every time, don't assume it stays fixed
- [ ] **[P0]** Exit 0 → `passed`; non-zero with a real assertion → `failed`; exit 2 → `uncertain`
- [ ] **[P0]** A broken check (`ImportError`/`AttributeError`/`NameError`/etc. as the last stderr line) → classified `error`, never counted as a failed change
- [ ] **[P2]** Memory-capped container (OOM, exit 137) → classified `error`, not `failed`
- [ ] **[P2]** Per-scenario timeout → container force-removed (`docker rm -f`), status `timeout`
- [ ] **[P2]** After a normal run, `docker ps -a` shows no leftover containers (`--rm` actually cleans up)
- [ ] **[P2]** `pip install` failure inside the container doesn't block test execution (best-effort install)

## 6. Risk Scorer

- [ ] **[P0]** 0 conclusive scenarios → `UNVERIFIED`
- [ ] **[P0]** conclusive evidence, 0 failures → `LOW`
- [ ] **[P1]** coverage ≥ 2/3 with ≥1 failure → `MEDIUM`
- [ ] **[P1]** coverage < 2/3 with ≥1 failure → `HIGH`
- [ ] **[P2]** boundary case at exactly 2/3 coverage lands on the documented side

## 7. Reporter

- [ ] **[P1]** `build_record` / `build_incomplete_record` — correct fields for completed vs errored/skipped runs
- [ ] **[P1]** `save_run` → `load_run` round-trips exactly
- [ ] **[P1]** `verdict runs` — table sorted newest-first, correct verdict/evidence columns for LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH/UNVERIFIED **and** errored/skipped rows
- [ ] **[P1]** `'last'` resolves to the newest run everywhere it's accepted (`logs`, `report`)
- [ ] **[P0]** `format_json` never leaks `diff`/`generation_prompt`/`test_code` (machine output stays slim, evidence stays in the full record on disk)
- [ ] **[P1]** `verdict report` — HTML renders correctly for a completed run AND for an errored/skipped one; opens standalone with no external assets

## 8. CLI + interactive shell

- [ ] **[P1]** Bare `verdict` → branded interactive shell; `help`, `clear`, `exit`/`quit` all work
- [ ] **[P1]** Every command runs identically inside the shell and as a direct CLI call
- [ ] **[P1]** `--json` on `run` produces valid, complete JSON
- [ ] **[P1]** `--path` works consistently across `run`, `plan`, and `watch`
- [ ] **[P0]** Exit code is 0 only when risk is `LOW`; every other outcome (MEDIUM/HIGH/UNVERIFIED/errored/skipped) exits non-zero

## 9. Live watch mode

- [ ] **[P1]** Several rapid edits within the settle window → exactly one verification fires, not one per save
- [ ] **[P1]** `.verdict/INTENT.md` is created on first run and read live on each cycle
- [ ] **[P0]** No intent available → warns and waits, never runs a guessed verdict
- [ ] **[P0]** Vague intent in `INTENT.md` → warns and waits for a better one
- [ ] **[P1]** Ctrl+C → clean exit with a session summary (count of verifications run)
- [ ] **[P1]** `--path` scoping limits both the watched fingerprint and the triggered run
- [ ] **[P0]** Verdict's own writes to `.verdict/` never re-trigger a verification (fingerprint excludes `.verdict/`)

## 10. Hybrid / manual merge

- [ ] **[P1]** `--scenarios <file>` alone → skips LLM scenario-gen entirely, runs only manual scenarios
- [ ] **[P1]** `--hybrid` → generated + manual scenarios merge
- [ ] **[P1]** Duplicate scenario (by name or ≥0.8 description overlap) → manual version wins, duplicate dropped
- [ ] **[P1]** `--hybrid` without `--scenarios` → rejected with a clear error

## 11. Git pre-push hook

- [ ] **[P1]** `install-hook` writes the hook; `uninstall-hook` removes it cleanly
- [ ] **[P0]** Installing over an existing foreign (non-Verdict) hook is refused, not overwritten
- [ ] **[P0]** Pushing a non-LOW-risk range is blocked
- [ ] **[P1]** `git push --no-verify` bypasses on purpose
- [ ] **[P0]** The hook verifies exactly the commit range being pushed, nothing more/less

## 12. Audit log

- [ ] **[P0]** Append-only: ids are strictly sequential, no entry is ever rewritten
- [ ] **[P1]** Unknown `action_type` is rejected at write time
- [ ] **[P0]** Every run's full lifecycle appears (`run_started` → `run_completed`/`run_errored`/`run_skipped`), none vanish
- [ ] **[P0]** `config_change` entries show masked keys only, before and after

## 13. Correctness fixes (this session — verify explicitly)

- [ ] **[P0]** **Dead-function detection**: a generated test that defines a check function but never calls it is caught by `find_dead_functions`, fed back to the model for a retry, and — if never fixed — the scenario becomes `ungeneratable` rather than a false `PASSED`
- [ ] **[P0]** **FAILED confirmation pass**: a scenario whose failure reproduces on independent regeneration stays `FAILED`; one that doesn't reproduce is downgraded to `uncertain` and recorded under `failure_not_reproduced` — never left as a confident but wrong `FAILED`
- [ ] **[P2]** Confirmation pass only fires for `FAILED` results — passed/uncertain/error scenarios don't pay the extra generation+sandbox cost
- [ ] **[P0]** **Broken-monkeypatch detection**: a generated test that does `from X import Y` and later `X.Y = fake` while also calling bare `Y(...)` is caught by `find_broken_monkeypatch` and fed back for a retry — this is exactly the failure shape the FAILED-confirmation pass structurally cannot catch (the model makes the same wrong assumption on every regeneration, so confirmation gives false confidence instead of catching it)
- [ ] **[P2]** `find_broken_monkeypatch` does NOT flag `unittest.mock.patch(...)` usage or consistent module-attribute access (only the direct-import + attribute-patch + bare-call combination)
- [ ] **[P0]** **Range vagueness fix**: a `--base` range whose HEAD commit is vague (`"wip"`) but contains a genuinely descriptive earlier commit is NOT flagged vague; a range where every commit is genuinely vague still is
- [ ] **[P0]** **Reproducibility fix**: the same fixed diff/intent, run through `verdict plan` repeatedly, produces the same scenario count and the same traceability result every time (temperature=0.0 + fixed seed) — a flip between e.g. 4/4 and 3/4 traceable on unchanged input is a regression
- [ ] **[P2]** A range built from a *moving* relative ref (e.g. `--base HEAD~2` re-run after adding more commits) is expected to change results — that's the ref pointing at different commits, not nondeterminism; don't confuse the two when testing
- [ ] **[P0]** **Validator embedded-term fix**: a scenario describing a real, embedded identifier form (e.g. `"password with digits"` against code that does `isdigit`) is traceable, not dropped — the term matcher must catch shared roots anywhere in the word, not just at the start
- [ ] **[P1]** **Intent display fix**: for a range accepted because an *older* commit is descriptive (not the newest), the displayed intent shows that governing commit, not just HEAD's message

## 14. Resilience / stress / isolation

- [ ] **[P2]** 10x in a row on the demo repo (live re-check of the Phase 1 gate shape) — zero crashes on current code
- [ ] **[P2]** Unicode/emoji in scenario output → no console crash on Windows
- [ ] **[P0]** Ollama down mid-run (killed during the scenario-gen call) → retry+backoff, then a clean `errored` record, no hang, no crash
- [ ] **[P0]** Docker down → clean `errored` record
- [ ] **[P2]** Ctrl+C mid-sandbox execution → no orphaned container afterward
- [ ] **[P2]** Cloud provider active with a bad/missing API key → clear error naming what's missing, not a crash
- [ ] **[P1]** Run from a completely separate repo → never touches this repo's own `.verdict/`, fully independent per-project state
